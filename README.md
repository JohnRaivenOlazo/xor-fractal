# xor-fractal: My DAA Mobile App 📱

Hey there! This is my mobile application for the DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) course. I built this app to help visualize and explore algorithmic concepts in a hands-on way, right from your phone. If you’re curious about how algorithms work or just want to play around with some fractals, you’re in the right place.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will open up a local server. You can scan the QR code with your phone (using the Expo Go app) or run it in an emulator/simulator if you have one set up.

   - [Android emulator setup](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator setup](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/go) (for quick testing on your device)

## How to Develop

All the main code lives in the `app/` directory. Routing is file-based, so just add or edit files there to create new screens or features. Styles are in `globals.css` and use Tailwind classes.

If you want to start fresh, you can run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will move the starter code to `app-example/` and give you a blank slate in `app/`.

## Why This App?

I made this for my DAA course project, but also because I wanted a fun way to see algorithms in action. The main feature is a fractal visualizer, but I plan to add more algorithm demos as I go. If you have ideas or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or PR.
