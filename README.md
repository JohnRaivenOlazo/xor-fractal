# xor-fractal: Mobile App with React Native ðŸ“±

This is my mobile application for the DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) course. It visualizes Rule 90 (an elementary cellular automaton) and lets you interact with the fractal grid. The app is designed to be simple, hands-on, and a bit fun for anyone interested in algorithms.

## Dev

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will open up a local server. You can scan the QR code with your phone (using the Expo Go app) or run it in an emulator/simulator if you have one set up.

   - [Android emulator setup](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator setup](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/go) (for quick testing on your device)

## Main

All the main code lives in the `app/` directory. Routing is file-based, so just add or edit files there to create new screens or features. Styles are in `globals.css` and use Tailwind classes.

## Why This App?

I made this for my DAA course project, but also because I wanted a fun way to see algorithms in action. The main feature is a fractal visualizer, but I plan to add more algorithm demos as I go. If you have ideas or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or PR.
